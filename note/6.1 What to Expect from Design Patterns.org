* 
  Here are several ways in which the design patterns in this book can affect the
  way you design object-oriented software, based on our day-to-day experience
  with them.
* A Common Design Vocabulary
  Studies of expert programmers for conventional languages have shown that
  knowledge and experience isn't organized simply around syntax but in larger
  conceptual structures such as algorithms, datastructures and idioms [AS85,
  Cop92, Cur89, SS86], and plans for fulfilling a particular goal [SE84].
  Designers probably don't think about the notation they're using for recording
  the design as much as they try to match the current design situation against
  plans, algorithms, data structures, and idioms they have learned in the past.

  Computer scientists name and catalog algorithms and data structures, but we
  don't often name other kinds of patterns. Design patterns provide a common
  vocabulary for designers to use to communicate, document, and explore design
  alternatives. Design patterns make a system seemless complex by letting you
  talk about it at a higher level of abstraction than that of a design notation
  or programming language. Design patterns raise the level at which you design
  and discuss design with your colleagues.

  Once you've absorbed the design patterns in this book, your design vocabulary
  will almost certainly change. You will speak directly in terms of the names of
  the design patterns. You'll find yourself saying things like, "Let's use an
  Observer here," or, "Let's make a Strategy out of these classes."
* A Documentation and Learning Aid
** 
   Knowing the design patterns in this book makes it easier to understand
   existing systems. Most large object-oriented systems use these design
   patterns. People learning object-oriented programming often complain that the
   systems they're working with use inheritance in convoluted ways and that it's
   difficult to follow the flow of control. In large part this is because they do
   not understand the design patterns in the system. Learning these design
   patterns will help you understand existing object-oriented systems.

   These design patterns can also make you a better designer. They provide
   solutions to common problems. If you work with object-oriented systems long
   enough, you'll probably learn these design patterns on your own. But reading
   the book will help you learn them much faster. Learning these patterns will
   help a novice act more like an expert.
** 
   Moreover, describing a system in terms of the design patterns that it uses
   will make it a lot easier to understand. Otherwise, people will have to
   reverse-engineer the design to unearth the patterns it uses. Having a common
   vocabulary means you don't have to describe the whole design pattern; you can
   just name it and expect your reader to know it. A reader who doesn't know the
   patterns will have to look them up at first, but that's still easier than
   reverse-engineering.

   We use these patterns in our own designs, and we've found them invaluable. Yet
   we use the patterns in arguably naive ways. We use them to pick names for
   classes, to think about and teach good design, and to describe designs in
   terms of the sequence of design patterns we applied [BJ94]. It's easy to
   imagine more sophisticated ways of using patterns, such as pattern-based CASE
   tools or hypertext documents. But patterns are a big help even without
   sophisticated tools.
* An Adjunct to Existing Methods
** 
   Object-oriented design methods are supposed to promote good design, to teach
   new designers how to design well, and to standardize the way designs are
   developed. A design method typically defines a set of notations (usually
   graphical) for modeling various aspects of a design, along with a set of rules
   that govern how and when to use each notation. Design methods usually describe
   problems that occur in adesign, how to resolve them, and how to evaluate
   design. But they haven't been able to capture the experience of expert
   designers.

   We believe our design patterns are an important piece that's been missing from
   object-oriented design methods. The design patterns show how to use primitive
   techniques such as objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. They show how to
   parameterize a system with an algorithm, a behavior, a state, or the kind of
   objects it's supposed to create. Design patterns provide a way to describe
   more of the "why" of a design and not just record the results of your
   decisions. The Applicability, Consequences, and Implementation sections of the
   design patterns help guide you in the decisions you have to make.
** 
   Design patterns are especially useful in turning an analysis model into an
   implementation model. Despite many claims that promise a smooth transition
   from object-oriented analysis to design, in practice the transition is
   anything but smooth. A flexible and reusable design will contain objects that
   aren't in the analysis model. The programming language and class libraries you
   use affect the design. Analysis models often must be redesigned to make them
   reusable. Many of the design patterns in the catalog address these issues,
   which is why we call them design patterns.

   A full-fledged design method requires more kinds of patterns than just design
   patterns. There can also be analysis patterns, user interface design patterns,
   or performance-tuning patterns. But the design patterns are an essential part,
   one that's been missing until now.
* A Target for Refactoring
** 
   One of the problems in developing reusable software is that it often has to be
   reorganized or refactored [OJ90]. Design patterns help you determine how to
   reorganize a design, and they can reduce the amount of refactoring you need to
   do later.

   The lifecycle of object-oriented software has several phases. Brian Foote
   identifies these phases as the prototyping, expansionary, and consolidating
   phases [Foo92].

   The prototyping phase is a flurry of activity as the software is brought to
   life through rapid prototyping and incremental changes, until it meets an
   initial set of requirements and reaches adolescence. At this point, the
   software usually consists of class hierarchies that closely reflect entities
   in the initial problem domain. The main kind of reuse is white-box reuse by
   inheritance.
** 
   Once the software has reached adolescence and is put into service, its
   evolution is governed by two conflicting needs: (1) the software must satisfy
   more requirements, and (2) the software must be more reusable. New
   requirements usually add new classes and operations and perhaps whole class
   hierarchies. The software goes through an expansionary phase to meet new
   requirements. This can't continue for long, however. Eventually the software
   will become too inflexible and arthritic for further change. The class
   hierarchies will no longer match any problem domain. Instead they'll reflect
   many problem domains, and classes will define many unrelated operations and
   instance variables.
** 
   To continue to evolve, the software must be reorganized in a process known as
   refactoring. This is the phase in which frameworks often emerge. Refactoring
   involves tearing apart classes into special-and general-purpose components,
   moving operations up or down the class hierarchy, and rationalizing the
   interfaces of classes. This consolidation phase produces many new kinds of
   objects, often by decomposing existing objects and using object composition
   instead of inheritance. Hence black-box reuse replaces white-box reuse. The
   continual need to satisfy more requirements along with the need for more
   reuse propels object-oriented software through repeated phases of expansion
   and consolidation—expansion as new requirements are satisfied, and
   consolidation as the software becomes more general.

   [[file:../img/A Target for Refactoring.png][A Target for Refactoring]]
** 
   This cycle is unavoidable. But good designers are aware of the changes that
   can prompt refactorings. Good designers also know class and object structures
   that can help avoid refactorings—their designsare robust in the face of
   requirement changes. A thorough requirements analysis will highlight those
   requirements that are likely to change during the life of the software, and a
   good design will be robust to them.

   Our design patterns capture many of the structures that result from
   refactoring. Using these patterns early in the life of a design prevents
   later refactorings. But even if you don't see how to apply a pattern until
   after you've built your system, the pattern can still show you how to change
   it. Design patterns thus provide targets for your refactorings.
* A Brief History
** 
   The catalog began as a part of Erich's Ph.D.thesis [Gam91, Gam92]. Roughly
   half of the current patterns were in his thesis. By OOPSLA '91 it was
   officially an independent catalog, and Richard had joined Erich to work on
   it.John started working on it soon thereafter. By OOPSLA '92, Ralph had joined
   the group. We worked hard to make the catalog fit for publication at ECOOP
   '93, but soon we realized that a 90-page paper was not going to be accepted.
   So we summarized the catalog and submitted the summary, which was accepted. We
   decided to turn the catalog into a book shortly thereafter.

   Our names for the patterns have changed a little along the way. "Wrapper"
   became "Decorator," "Glue" became "Facade,""Solitaire" became "Singleton," and
   "Walker" became "Visitor."A couple of patterns got dropped because they didn't
   seem important enough. But otherwise the set of patterns in the catalog has
   changed little since the end of 1992. The patterns themselves, however, have
   evolved tremendously.

   In fact, noticing that something is a pattern is the easy part. All four of us
   are actively working on building object-oriented systems, and we've found that
   it's easy to spot patterns when you look at enough systems. But finding
   patterns is much easier than describing them.
** 
   If you build systems and then reflect on what you build, you will see patterns
   in what you do. But it's hard to describe patterns so that people who don't
   know them will understand them and realize why they are important. Experts
   immediately recognized the value of the catalog in its early stages. But the
   only ones who could understand the patterns were those who had already used
   them.

   Since one of the main purposes of the book was to teach object-oriented design
   to new designers, we knew we had to improve the catalog. We expanded the
   average size of a pattern from less than 2to more than 10 pages by including a
   detailed motivating example and sample code. We also started examining the
   trade-offs and the various ways of implementing the pattern. This made the
   patterns easier to learn.
** 
   Another important change over the past year has been a greater emphasis on
   the problem that a pattern solves. It's easiest to see a pattern as a
   solution, as a technique that can be adapted and reused. It's harder to see
   when it is appropriate—to characterize the problems it solves and the context
   in which it's the best solution. In general, it's easier to see what someone
   is doing than to know why, and the "why" for a pattern is the problem it
   solves. Knowing the purpose of a pattern is important too, because it helps
   us choose patterns to apply. It also helps us understand the design of
   existing systems. A pattern author must determine and characterize the
   problem that the pattern solves, even if you have to do it after you've
   discovered its solution.
* The Pattern Community
** 
   We aren't the only ones interested in writing books that catalog the patterns
   experts use. We are a part of a larger community interested in patterns in
   general and software-related patterns in particular. Christopher Alexander is
   the architect who first studied patterns in buildings and communities and
   developed a "pattern language" for generating them. His work has inspired us
   time and again. So it's fitting and worthwhile to compare our work to his.
   Then we'll look at others' work in software-related patterns.
** Alexander's Pattern Languages
*** 
    There are many ways in which our work is like Alexander's. Both are based on
    observing existing systems and looking for patterns in them. Both have
    templates for describing patterns (although our templates are quite
    different). Both rely on natural language and lots of examples to describe
    patterns rather than formal languages, and both give rationales for each
    pattern.

    But there are just as many ways in which our works are different:
    1. People have been making buildings for thousands of years, and there are
       many classic examples to draw upon. We have been making software systems
       for a relatively short time, and few are considered classics.
    2. Alexander gives an order in which his patterns should be used; we have
       not.
    3. Alexander's patterns emphasize the problems they address, whereas design
       patterns describe the solutions in more detail.
    4. Alexander claims his patterns will generate complete buildings. We do not
       claim that our patterns will generate complete programs.
*** 
    When Alexander claims you can design a house simply by applying his patterns
    one after another, he has goals similar to those of object-oriented design
    methodologists who give step-by-step rules for design. Alexander doesn't deny
    the need for creativity; some of his patterns require understanding the
    living habits of the people who will use the building, and his belief in the
    "poetry" of design implies a level of expertise beyond the pattern language
    itself. But his description of how patterns generate designs implies that a
    pattern language can make the design process deterministic and repeatable.

    The Alexandrian point of view has helped us focus on design trade-offs—the
    different "forces" that help shape a design. His influence made us work
    harder to understand the applicability and consequences of our patterns. It
    also kept us from worrying about defining a formal representation of
    patterns. Although such are presentation might make automating patterns
    possible, at this stage it's more important to explore the space of design
    patterns than to formalize it.
*** 
    From Alexander's point of view, the patterns in this book do not form a
    pattern language. Given the variety of software systems that people build,
    it's hard to see how we could provide a "complete" set of patterns, one that
    offers step-by-step instructions for designing an application. We can do that
    for certain classes of applications, such as report-writing or making a
    forms-entry system. But our catalog is just a collection of related patterns;
    we can't pretend it's a pattern language.

    In fact, we think it's unlikely that there will ever be a complete pattern
    language for software. But it's certainly possible to make one that is more
    complete. Additions would have to include frameworks and how to use them
    [Joh92], patterns for user interface design [BJ94], analysis patterns
    [Coa92], and all the other aspects of developing software. Design patterns
    are just a part of a larger pattern language for software.
** Patterns in Software
*** 
    Our first collective experience in the study of software architecture was at
    an OOPSLA '91 workshop led by Bruce Anderson. The workshop was dedicated to
    developing a handbook for software architects. (Judging from this book, we
    suspect "architecture encyclopedia" will be a more appropriate name than
    "architecture handbook.") That first workshop has led to a series of
    meetings, the most recent of which being the first conference on Pattern
    Languages of Programs held in August 1994. This has created a community of
    people interested in documenting software expertise.

    Of course, others have had this goal as well. Donald Knuth's The Art of
    Computer Programming [Knu73] was one of the first attempts to catalog
    software knowledge, though he focused on describing algorithms. Even so, the
    task proved too great to finish. The Graphics Gemsseries [Gla90, Arv91,
    Kir92] is an other catalog of design knowledge, though it too tends to focus
    on algorithms. The Domain Specific Software Architecture program sponsored by
    the U.S. Department of Defense [GM92] concentrates on gathering architectural
    information. The knowledge-based software engineering community tries to
    represent software-related knowledge in general. There are many other group
    swith goals at least a little like ours.
*** 
    James Coplien's Advanced C++: Programming Styles and Idioms [Cop92] has
    influenced us, too. The patterns in his book tend to be more C++-specific
    than our design patterns, and his book contains lots of lower-level patterns
    as well. But there is some overlap, as we point out in our patterns. Jim has
    been active in the pattern community. He's currently working on patterns
    that describe people's roles in software development organizations.

    There are a lot of other places in which to find descriptions of patterns.
    Kent Beck was one of the first people in the software community to advocate
    Christopher Alexander's work. In 1993 he started writing a column in The
    Smalltalk Report on Smalltalk patterns. Peter Coad has also been collecting
    patterns for some time. His paper on patterns seems to us to contain mostly
    analysis patterns [Coa92]; we haven't seen his latest patterns, though we
    know he is still working on them. We've heard of several books on patterns
    that are in the works, but we haven't seen any of them, either. All we can
    do is let you know they're coming. One of these books will be from the
    Pattern Languages of Programs conference.
* An Invitation
** 
   What can you do if you are interested in patterns? First, use them and look
   for other patterns that fit the way you design. A lot of books and articles
   about patterns will be coming out in the next few years, so there will be
   plenty of sources for new patterns. Develop your vocabulary of patterns, and
   use it. Use it when you talk with other people about your designs. Use it
   when you think and write about them.

   Second, be a critical consumer. The design pattern catalog is the result of
   hard work, not just ours but that of dozens of reviewers who gave us
   feedback. If you spot a problem or believe more explanation is needed,
   contact us. The same goes for any other catalog of patterns: Give the authors
   feedback! One of the great things about patterns is that they move design
   decisions out of the realm of vague intuition. They let authors be explicit
   about the trade-offs they make. This makes it easier to see what is wrong
   with their patterns and to argue with them. Take advantage of that.
** 
   Third, look for patterns you use, and write them down. Make them apart of
   your documentation. Show them to other people. You don't have to be in a
   research lab to find patterns. In fact, finding relevant patterns is nearly
   impossible if you don't have practical experience. Feel free to write your
   own catalog of patterns...but make sure someone else helps you beat them into
   shape!
* A Parting Thought
  The best designs will use many design patterns that dovetail and intertwine to
  produce a greater whole. As Christopher Alexander says:

  It is possible to make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a rather
  loose way. A building made like this, is an assembly of patterns. It is not
  dense. It is not profound. But it is also possible to put patterns together in
  such a way that many patterns overlap in the same physical space: the building
  is very dense; it has many meanings captured in a small space; and through
  this density, it becomes profound.
