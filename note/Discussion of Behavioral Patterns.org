* Encapsulating Variation
** 
   Encapsulating variation is a theme of many behavioral patterns. When an aspect
   of a program changes frequently, these patterns define an object that
   encapsulates that aspect. Then other parts of the program can collaborate with
   the object whenever they depend on that aspect. The patterns usually define an
   abstract class that describes the encapsulating object, and the pattern
   derives its name from that object. For example,
   - a Strategy object encapsulates an algorithm,
   - a State object encapsulates a state-dependent behavior,
   - a Mediator object encapsulates the protocol between objects, and
   - an Iterator object encapsulates the way you access and traverse the
     components of an aggregate object.
   These patterns describe aspects of a program that are likely to change. Most
   patterns have two kinds of objects: the new object(s) that encapsulate the
   aspect, and the existing object(s) that use the new ones. Usually the
   functionality of new objects would be an integral part of the existing
   objects were it not for the pattern. For example, code for a Strategy would
   probably be wired into the strategy's Context, and code for a State would be
   implemented directly in the state's Context.
** 
   But not all object behavioral patterns partition functionality like this. For
   example, Chain of Responsibility deals with an arbitrary number of objects
   (i.e., a chain), all of which may already exist in the system.

   Chain of Responsibility illustrates another difference in behavioral
   patterns: Not all define static communication relationships between classes.
   Chain of Responsibility prescribes communication between an open-ended number
   of objects. Other patterns involve objects that are passed around as
   arguments.
* Objects as Arguments
  Several patterns introduce an object that's always used as an argument. One of
  these is Visitor. A Visitor object is the argument to a polymorphic Accept
  operation on the objects it visits. The visitor is never considered a part of
  those objects, even though the conventional alternative to the pattern is to
  distribute Visitor code across the object structure classes.

  Other patterns define objects that act as magic tokens to be passed around and
  invoked at a later time. Both Command and Memento fall into this category. In
  Command, the token represents a request; in Memento, it represents the
  internal state of an object at a particular time. In both cases, the token can
  have a complex internal representation, but the client is never aware of it.
  But even here there are differences. Polymorphism is important in the Command
  pattern, because executing the Command object is a polymorphic operation.
  Incontrast, the Memento interface is so narrow that a memento can only be
  passed as a value. So it's likely to present no polymorphic operations at all
  to its clients.
* Should Communication be Encapsulated or Distributed?
** 
   Mediator and Observer are competing patterns. The difference between them is
   that Observer distributes communication by introducing Observer and Subject
   objects, whereas a Mediator object encapsulates the communication between
   other objects.

   In the Observer pattern, there is no single object that encapsulates a
   constraint. Instead, the Observer and the Subject must cooperate to maintain
   the constraint. Communication patterns are determined by the way observers
   and subjects are interconnected: a single subject usually has many observers,
   and sometimes the observer of one subject is a subject of another observer.
   The Mediator pattern centralizes rather than distributes. It places the
   responsibility for maintaining a constraint squarely in the mediator.

   We've found it easier to make reusable Observers and Subjects than to make
   reusable Mediators. The Observer pattern promotes partitioning and loose
   coupling between Observer and Subject, and that leads to finer-grained
   classes that are more apt to be reused.
** 
   On the other hand, it's easier to understand the flow of communicationin
   Mediator than in Observer. Observers and subjects are usually connected
   shortly after they're created, and it's hard to see how they are connected
   later in the program. If you know the Observer pattern, then you understand
   that the way observers and subjects are connected is important, and you also
   know what connections to look for. However, the indirection that Observer
   introduces will still make a system harder to understand.

   Observers in Smalltalk can be parameterized with messages to access the
   Subject state, and so they are even more reusable than they are in C++. This
   makes Observer more attractive than Mediator in Smalltalk. Thus a Smalltalk
   programmer will often use Observer where a C++ programmer would use Mediator.
* Decoupling Senders and Receivers
** 
   When collaborating objects refer to each other directly, they become dependent
   on each other, and that can have an adverse impact on the layering and
   reusability of a system. Command, Observer, Mediator, and Chain of
   Responsibility address how you can decouple senders and receivers, but with
   different trade-offs.

   The Command pattern supports decoupling by using a Command object to define
   the binding between a sender and receiver:
  
   [[file:../img/Decoupling Senders and Receivers.png][Decoupling Senders and Receivers]]
** 
   The Command object provides a simple interface for issuing the request(that
   is, the Execute operation). Defining the sender-receiver connection in a
   separate object lets the sender work with different receivers. It keeps the
   sender decoupled from the receivers, making senders easy to reuse. Moreover,
   you can reuse the Command object to parameterize a receiver with different
   senders. The Command pattern nominally requires a subclass for each
   sender-receiver connection, although the pattern describes implementation
   techniques that avoid subclassing.

   The Observer pattern decouples senders (subjects) from receivers(observers) by
   defining an interface for signaling changes in subjects. Observer defines a
   looser sender-receiver binding than Command, since a subject may have multiple
   observers, and their number can vary at run-time.

   [[file:../img/Decoupling Senders and Receivers-0.png][Decoupling Senders and Receivers]]
** 
   The Subject and Observer interfaces in the Observer pattern are designed for
   communicating changes. Therefore the Observer pattern is best for decoupling
   objects when there are data dependencies between them.

   The Mediator pattern decouples objects by having them refer to eachother
   indirectly through a Mediator object.

   [[file:../img/Decoupling Senders and Receivers-1.png][Decoupling Senders and Receivers]]

   A Mediator object routes requests between Colleague objects and centralizes
   their communication. Consequently, colleagues can only talk to each other
   through the Mediator interface. Because this interface is fixed, the Mediator
   might have to implement its own dispatching scheme for added flexibility.
   Requests can be encoded and arguments packed in such a way that colleagues
   can request an open-ended set of operations.
** 
   The Mediator pattern can reduce subclassing in a system, because it
   centralizes communication behavior in one class instead of distributing it
   among subclasses. However, ad hoc dispatching schemes often decrease type
   safety.

   Finally, the Chain of Responsibility pattern decouples the sender from the
   receiver by passing the request along a chain of potential receivers:

   [[file:../img/Decoupling Senders and Receivers-2.png][Decoupling Senders and Receivers]]

   Since the interface between senders and receivers is fixed, Chain of
   Responsibility may also require a custom dispatching scheme. Hence it has the
   same type-safety drawbacks as Mediator. Chain of Responsibility is a good way
   to decouple the sender and the receiver if the chain is already part of the
   system's structure, and one of several objects may be in a position to handle
   the request. Moreover, the pattern offers added flexibility in that the chain
   can be changed or extended easily.
* Summary
** 
   With few exceptions, behavioral design patterns complement and reinforce each
   other. A class in a chain of responsibility, for example, will probably
   include at least one application of Template Method. The template method can
   use primitive operations to determine whether the object should handle the
   request and to choose the object to forward to. The chain can use the Command
   pattern to represent requests as objects. Interpreter can use the State
   pattern to define parsing contexts. An iterator can traverse an aggregate,
   and a visitor can apply an operation to each element in the aggregate.
** 
   Behavioral patterns work well with other patterns, too. For example, a system
   that uses the Composite pattern might use a visitor to perform operations on
   components of the composition. It could use Chain of Responsibility to let
   components access global properties through their parent. It could also use
   Decorator to override these properties on parts of the composition. It could
   use the Observer pattern to tie one object structure to another and the State
   pattern to let a component change its behavior as its state changes. The
   composition itself might be created using the approach in Builder, and it
   might be treated as a Prototype by some other part of the system.
   Well-designed object-oriented systems are just like this—they have multiple
   patterns embedded in them—but not because their designers necessarily thought
   in these terms. Composition at the pattern level rather than the class or
   object levels lets us achieve the same synergy with greater ease.
