* Intent
  Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
* Motivation
** -
  Some applications could benefit from using objects throughout their design, but
  a naive implementation would be prohibitively expensive.

  For example, most document editor implementations have text formatting and editing
  facilities that are modularized to some extent. Object-oriented document editors
  typically use objects to represent embedded elements like tables and figures.
  However, they usually stop short of using an object for each character in the
  document, even though doing so would promote flexibility at the finest levels
  in the application. Characters and embedded elements could then be treated
  uniformly with respect to how they are drawn and formatted. The application could
  be extended to support new character sets without disturbing other functionality.
  The application's object structure could mimic the document's physical structure.
  The following diagram shows how a document editor can use objects to represent
  characters.

  [[file:img/flyweight motivation document editor.png][flyweight motivation document editor]]

  The drawback of such a design is its cost. Even moderate-sized documents may
  require hundreds of thousands of character objects, which will consume lots of
  memory and may incur unacceptable run-time overhead. The Flyweight pattern
  describes how to share objects to allow their use at fine granularities
  without prohibitive cost.
** -
  A *flyweight* is a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts
  simultaneously. The flyweight acts as an independent object in each
  context—it's indistinguishable from an instance of the object that's not
  shared. Flyweights cannot make assumptions about the context in which they
  operate. The key concept here is the distinction between *intrinsic* and
  *extrinsic* state. Intrinsic state is stored in the flyweight; it consists of
  information that's independent of the flyweight's context, thereby making it
  sharable. Extrinsic state depends on and varies with the flyweight's context
  and therefore can't be shared. Client objects are responsible for passing
  extrinsic state to the flyweight when it needs it.

  Flyweights model concepts or entities that are normally too plentiful to
  represent with objects. For example, a document editor can create a flyweight
  for each letter of the alphabet. Each flyweight stores a character code, but
  its coordinate position in the document and its typographic style can be
  determined from the text layout algorithms and formatting commands in effect
  wherever the character appears. The character code is intrinsic state, while
  the other information is extrinsic.

  Logically there is an object for every occurrence of a given character in the
  document:

  [[file:img/facade motivation logical ch.png][facade motivation logical ch]]

  Physically, however, there is one shared flyweight object per character, and
  it appears in different contexts in the document structure. Each occurrence of
  a particular character object refers to the same instance in the shared pool
  of flyweight objects:

  [[file:img/flyweight pool.png][flyweight pool]]
** -
  The class structure for these objects is shown next. Glyph is the abstract
  class for graphical objects, some of which may be flyweights. Operations that
  may depend on extrinsic state have it passed to them as a parameter. For
  example, Draw and Intersects must know which context the glyph is in before
  they can do their job.

  [[file:img/flyweight glyph class .png][flyweight glyph class]]

  A flyweight representing the letter "a" only stores the corresponding
  character code; it doesn't need to store its location or font. Clients supply
  the context-dependent information that the flyweight needs to draw itself. For
  example, a Row glyph knows where its children should draw themselves so that
  they are tiled horizontally. Thus it can pass each child its location in the
  draw request.

  Because the number of different character objects is far less than the number
  of characters in the document, the total number of objects is substantially
  less than what a naive implementation would use. A document in which all
  characters appear in the same font and color will allocate on the order of 100
  character objects (roughly the size of the ASCII character set) regardless of
  the document's length. And since most documents use no more than 10 different
  font-color combinations, this number won't grow appreciably in practice. An
  object abstraction thus becomes practical for individual characters.
* Applicability
  The Flyweight pattern's effectiveness depends heavily on how and where it's
  used. Apply the Flyweight pattern when all of the following are true:
  - An application uses a large number of objects.
  - Storage costs are high because of the sheer quantity of objects.
  - Most object state can be made extrinsic.
  - Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once
    extrinsic state is removed.
  - The application doesn't depend on object identity. Since flyweight objects
    may be shared, identity tests will return true for conceptually distinct
    objects.
* Structure
  [[file:img/flyweight structure.png][flyweight structure]]

  The following object diagram shows how flyweights are shared:

  [[file:img/flyweight structure how shared.png][flyweight structure how shared]]
* Participants
  - Flyweight
    - declares an interface through which flyweights can receive and act on
      extrinsic state.
  - ConcreteFlyweight (Character)
    - implements the Flyweight interface and adds storage for intrinsic state,
      if any. A ConcreteFlyweight object must be sharable. Any state it stores
      must be intrinsic; that is, it must be independent of the
      ConcreteFlyweight object's context.
  - UnsharedConcreteFlyweight (Row, Column)
    - not all Flyweight subclasses need to be shared. The Flyweight interface
      enables sharing; it doesn't enforce it. It's common for
      UnsharedConcreteFlyweight objects to have ConcreteFlyweight objects as
      children at some level in the flyweight object structure (as the Row and
      Column classes have).
  - FlyweightFactory
    - creates and manages flyweight objects.
    - ensures that flyweights are shared properly. When a client requests a
      flyweight, the FlyweightFactory object supplies an existing instance or
      creates one, if none exists.
  - Client
    - maintains a reference to flyweight(s).
    - computes or stores the extrinsic state of flyweight(s).
* Collaborations
  - State that a flyweight needs to function must be characterized as either
    intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic state is stored in the ConcreteFlyweight
    object; extrinsic state is stored or computed by Client objects. Clients
    pass this state to the flyweight when they invoke its operations.
  - Clients should not instantiate ConcreteFlyweights directly. Clients must
    obtain ConcreteFlyweight objects exclusively from the FlyweightFactory
    object to ensure they are shared properly.
* Consequences
  Flyweights may introduce run-time costs associated with transferring, finding,
  and/or computing extrinsic state, especially if it was formerly stored as
  intrinsic state. However, such costs are offset by space savings, which
  increase as more flyweights are shared.

  Storage savings are a function of several factors:
  - the reduction in the total number of instances that comes from sharing
  - the amount of intrinsic state per object
  - whether extrinsic state is computed or stored.

  The more flyweights are shared, the greater the storage savings. The savings
  increase with the amount of shared state. The greatest savings occur when the
  objects use substantial quantities of both intrinsic and extrinsic state, and
  the extrinsic state can be computed rather than stored. Then you save on
  storage in two ways: Sharing reduces the cost of intrinsic state, and you
  trade extrinsic state for computation time.

  The Flyweight pattern is often combined with the Composite pattern to
  represent a hierarchical structure as a graph with shared leaf nodes. A
  consequence of sharing is that flyweight leaf nodes cannot store a pointer to
  their parent. Rather, the parent pointer is passed to the flyweight as part of
  its extrinsic state. This has a major impact on how the objects in the
  hierarchy communicate with each other.
* Implementation
  Consider the following issues when implementing the Flyweight pattern:
  1. Removing extrinsic state. The pattern's applicability is determined largely
     by how easy it is to identify extrinsic state and remove it from shared
     objects. Removing extrinsic state won't help reduce storage costs if there
     are as many different kinds of extrinsic state as there are objects before
     sharing. Ideally, extrinsic state can be computed from a separate object
     structure, one with far smaller storage requirements.

     In our document editor, for example, we can store a map of typographic
     information in a separate structure rather than store the font and type
     style with each character object. The map keeps track of runs of characters
     with the same typographic attributes. When a character draws itself, it
     receives its typographic attributes as a side-effect of the draw traversal.
     Because documents normally use just a few different fonts and styles,
     storing this information externally to each character object is far more
     efficient than storing it internally.
  2. Managing shared objects. Because objects are shared, clients shouldn't
     instantiate them directly. FlyweightFactory lets clients locate a
     particular flyweight. FlyweightFactory objects often use an associative
     store to let clients look up flyweights of interest. For example, the
     flyweight factory in the document editor example can keep a table of
     flyweights indexed by character codes. The manager returns the proper
     flyweight given its code, creating the flyweight if it does not already
     exist.

     Sharability also implies some form of reference counting or garbage
     collection to reclaim a flyweight's storage when it's no longer needed.
     However, neither is necessary if the number of flyweights is fixed and
     small (e.g., flyweights for the ASCII character set). In that case, the
     flyweights are worth keeping around permanently.
* Sample Code
** -
  Returning to our document formatter example, we can define a Glyph base class
  for flyweight graphical objects. Logically, glyphs are Composites that have
  graphical attributes and can draw themselves. Here we focus on just the font
  attribute, but the same approach can be used for any other graphical
  attributes a glyph might have.
  #+begin_src c++ 
    class Glyph {
    public:
      virtual ~Glyph();
      virtual void Draw(Window*, GlyphContext&);
      virtual void SetFont(Font*, GlyphContext&);
      virtual Font* GetFont(GlyphContext&);
      virtual void First(GlyphContext&);
      virtual void Next(GlyphContext&);
      virtual bool IsDone(GlyphContext&);
      virtual Glyph* Current(GlyphContext&);
      virtual void Insert(Glyph*, GlyphContext&);
      virtual void Remove(GlyphContext&);
    protected:
      Glyph();
    };
  #+end_src
  
  The Character subclass just stores a character code:
  #+begin_src c++ 
    class Character : public Glyph {
    public:
      Character(char);
      virtual void Draw(Window*, GlyphContext&);
    private:
      char _charcode;
    };
  #+end_src
** -  
  To keep from allocating space for a font attribute in every glyph, we'll store
  the attribute extrinsically in a GlyphContext object. GlyphContext acts as a
  repository of extrinsic state. It maintains a compact mapping between a glyph
  and its font (and any other graphical attributes it might have) in different
  contexts. Any operation that needs to know the glyph's font in a given context
  will have a GlyphContext instance passed to it as a parameter. The operation can
  then query the GlyphContext for the font in that context. The context depends
  on the glyph's location in the glyph structure. Therefore Glyph's child iteration
  and manipulation operations must update the GlyphContext whenever they're used.
  #+begin_src c++ 
    class GlyphContext {
    public:
      GlyphContext();
      virtual ~GlyphContext();
      virtual void Next(int step = 1);
      virtual void Insert(int quantity = 1);
      virtual Font* GetFont();
      virtual void SetFont(Font*, int span = 1);
  
    private:
      int _index;
      BTree* _fonts;
    };
  #+end_src
  
  GlyphContext must be kept informed of the current position in the glyph
  structure during traversal. GlyphContext::Next increments _index as the
  traversal proceeds. Glyph subclasses that have children (e.g., Row and Column)
  must implement Next so that it calls GlyphContext::Next at each point in the
  traversal.

  GlyphContext::GetFont uses the index as a key into a BTree structure that stores
  the glyph-to-font mapping. Each node in the tree is labeled with the length of
  the string for which it gives font information. Leaves in the tree point to a
  font, while interior nodes break the string into substrings, one for each child.
** -
  Consider the following excerpt from a glyph composition:

  [[file:img/flyweight sample code.png][flyweight sample code]]

  The BTree structure for font information might look like

  [[file:img/flyweight sample code Btree.png][flyweight sample code Btree]]

  *Interior nodes define ranges of glyph indices*. BTree is updated in response
  to font changes and whenever glyphs are added to or removed from the glyph
  structure. For example, assuming we're at index 102 in the traversal, the
  following code sets the font of each character in the word "expect" to that of
  the surrounding text (that is, times12, an instance of Font for 12-point Times
  Roman):
  #+begin_src c++ 
  GlyphContext gc;
  Font* times12 = new Font("Times-Roman-12");
  Font* timesItalic12 = new Font("Times-Italic-12");
  // ...
  gc.SetFont(times12, 6);
  #+end_src
  
  The new BTree structure (with changes shown in black) looks like

  [[file:img/flyweight sample code 0.png]]

  Suppose we add the word "don't " (including a trailing space) in 12-point Times
  Italic before "expect." The following code informs the gc of this event, assuming
  it is still at index 102:
  #+begin_src c++ 
  gc.Insert(6);
  gc.SetFont(timesItalic12, 6);
  #+end_src
  
  The BTree structure becomes

  [[file:img/flyweight%20sample%20code%201.png][flyweight sample code 1.png]]
** -
  When the GlyphContext is queried for the font of the current glyph, it descends
  the BTree, adding up indices as it goes until it finds the font for the current
  index. Because the frequency of font changes is relatively low, the tree stays
  small relative to the size of the glyph structure. This keeps storage costs down
  without an inordinate increase in look-up time. 3

  The last object we need is a FlyweightFactory that creates glyphs and ensures
  they're shared properly. Class GlyphFactory instantiates Character and other kinds
  of glyphs. We only share Character objects; composite glyphs are far less plentiful,
  and their important state (i.e., their children) is intrinsic anyway.
  #+begin_src c++ 
    const int NCHARCODES = 128;

    class GlyphFactory {
    public:
      GlyphFactory();
  
      virtual ~GlyphFactory();
      virtual Character* CreateCharacter(char);
      virtual Row* CreateRow();
      virtual Column* CreateColumn();
      // ...
    private:
      Character* _character[NCHARCODES];
    };
  #+end_src
  
  The _character array contains pointers to Character glyphs indexed by character
  code. The array is initialized to zero in the constructor.
  #+begin_src c++ 
    GlyphFactory::GlyphFactory () {
      for (int i = 0; i < NCHARCODES; ++i) {
        _character[i] = 0;
      }
    }
  #+end_src
** -  
  CreateCharacter looks up a character in the character glyph in the array, and
  it returns the corresponding glyph if it exists. If it doesn't, then
  CreateCharacter creates the glyph, puts it in the array, and returns it:
  #+begin_src c++ 
    Character* GlyphFactory::CreateCharacter (char c) {
      if (!_character[c]) {
        _character[c] = new Character(c);
      }
  
      return _character[c];
    }
  #+end_src
  
  The other operations simply instantiate a new object each time they're called,
  since noncharacter glyphs won't be shared:
  #+begin_src c++ 
    Row* GlyphFactory::CreateRow () {
      return new Row;
    }

    Column* GlyphFactory::CreateColumn () {
      return new Column;
    }
  #+end_src
  
  We could omit these operations and let clients instantiate unshared glyphs
  directly. However, if we decide to make these glyphs sharable later, we'll
  have to change client code that creates them.
* Known Uses
  The concept of flyweight objects was first described and explored as a design
  technique in InterViews 3.0 [CL90]. Its developers built a powerful document
  editor called Doc as a proof of concept [CL92]. Doc uses glyph objects to
  represent each character in the document. The editor builds one Glyph instance
  for each character in a particular style (which defines its graphical
  attributes); hence a character's intrinsic state consists of the character
  code and its style information (an index into a style table). 4 That means
  only position is extrinsic, making Doc fast. Documents are represented by a
  class Document, which also acts as the FlyweightFactory. Measurements on Doc
  have shown that sharing flyweight characters is quite effective. In a typical
  case, a document containing 180,000 characters required allocation of only 480
  character objects.

  ET++ [WGM88] uses flyweights to support look-and-feel independence. 5 The
  look-and-feel standard affects the layout of user interface elements (e.g.,
  scroll bars, buttons, menus—known collectively as "widgets") and their
  decorations (e.g., shadows, beveling). A widget delegates all its layout and
  drawing behavior to a separate Layout object. Changing the Layout object
  changes the look and feel, even at run-time.

  For each widget class there is a corresponding Layout class (e.g.,
  ScrollbarLayout, MenubarLayout, etc.). An obvious problem with this approach
  is that using separate layout objects doubles the number of user interface
  objects: For each user interface object there is an additional Layout object.
  To avoid this overhead, Layout objects are implemented as flyweights. They
  make good flyweights because they deal mostly with defining behavior, and it's
  easy to pass them what little extrinsic state they need to lay out or draw an
  object.

  The Layout objects are created and managed by Look objects. The Look class is
  an Abstract Factory that retrieves a specific Layout object with operations
  like GetButtonLayout, GetMenuBarLayout, and so forth. For each look-and-feel
  standard there is a corresponding Look subclass (e.g., MotifLook, OpenLook)
  that supplies the appropriate Layout objects.

  By the way, Layout objects are essentially strategies. They are an example of
  a strategy object implemented as a flyweight.
* Related Patterns
  The Flyweight pattern is often combined with the Composite (183) pattern to
  implement a logically hierarchical structure in terms of a directed-acyclic
  graph with shared leaf nodes.

  It's often best to implement State and Strategy objects as flyweights.
