* Intent
  Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
  Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the
  elements on which it operates.
* Motivation
** -
   Consider a compiler that represents programs as abstract syntax trees. It
   will need to perform operations on abstract syntax trees for "static
   semantic" analyses like checking that all variables are defined. It will also
   need to generate code. So it might define operations for type-checking, code
   optimization, flow analysis, checking for variables being assigned values
   before they're used, and so on. Moreover, we could use the abstract syntax
   trees for pretty-printing, program restructuring, code instrumentation, and
   computing various metrics of a program.

   Most of these operations will need to treat nodes that represent assignment
   statements differently from nodes that represent variables or arithmetic
   expressions. Hence there will be one class for assignment statements, another
   for variable accesses, another for arithmetic expressions, and so on. The set
   of node classes depends on the language being compiled, of course, but it
   doesn't change much for a given language.
** -
   [[file:img/visitor motivation.png][visitor motivation]]

   This diagram shows part of the Node class hierarchy. The problem here is that
   distributing all these operations across the various node classes leads to a
   system that's hard to understand, maintain, and change. It will be confusing
   to have type-checking code mixed with pretty-printing code or flow analysis
   code. Moreover, adding a new operation usually requires recompiling all of
   these classes. It would be better if each new operation could be added
   separately, and the node classes were independent of the operations that
   apply to them.

   We can have both by packaging related operations from each class in a
   separate object, called a visitor, and passing it to elements of the abstract
   syntax tree as it's traversed. When an element "accepts" the visitor, it
   sends a request to the visitor that encodes the element's class. It also
   includes the element as an argument. The visitor will then execute the
   operation for that element—the operation that used to be in the class of the
   element.
** -
   For example, a compiler that didn't use visitors might type-check a procedure
   by calling the TypeCheck operation on its abstract syntax tree. Each of the
   nodes would implement TypeCheck by calling TypeCheck on its components (see
   the preceding class diagram). If the compiler type-checked a procedure using
   visitors, then it would create a TypeCheckingVisitor object and call the
   Accept operation on the abstract syntax tree with that object as an argument.
   Each of the nodes would implement Accept by calling back on the visitor: an
   assignment node calls VisitAssignment operation on the visitor, while a
   variable reference calls VisitVariableReference. What used to be the
   TypeCheck operation in class AssignmentNode is now the VisitAssignment
   operation on TypeCheckingVisitor.

   To make visitors work for more than just type-checking, we need an abstract
   parent class NodeVisitor for all visitors of an abstract syntax tree.
   NodeVisitor must declare an operation for each node class. An application
   that needs to compute program metrics will define new subclasses of
   NodeVisitor and will no longer need to add application-specific code to the
   node classes. The Visitor pattern encapsulates the operations for each
   compilation phase in a Visitor associated with that phase.

   [[file:img/visitor motivation 1.png][visitor motivation]]

   With the Visitor pattern, you define two class hierarchies: one for the
   elements being operated on (the Node hierarchy) and one for the visitors that
   define operations on the elements (the NodeVisitor hierarchy). You create a
   new operation by adding a new subclass to the visitor class hierarchy. As
   long as the grammar that the compiler accepts doesn't change (that is, we
   don't have to add new Node subclasses), we can add new functionality simply
   by defining new NodeVisitor subclasses.
* Applicability
  Use the Visitor pattern when
  - an object structure contains many classes of objects with differing
    interfaces, and you want to perform operations on these objects that depend
    on their concrete classes.
  - many distinct and unrelated operations need to be performed on objects in an
    object structure, and you want to avoid "polluting" their classes with these
    operations. Visitor lets you keep related operations together by defining
    them in one class. When the object structure is shared by many applications,
    use Visitor to put operations in just those applications that need them.
  - the classes defining the object structure rarely change, but you often want
    to define new operations over the structure. Changing the object structure
    classes requires redefining the interface to all visitors, which is
    potentially costly. If the object structure classes change often, then it's
    probably better to define the operations in those classes.
* Structure 
  [[file:img/visitor Structure.png][visitor Structure]]
* Participants
** -
   Visitor (NodeVisitor)
   - declares a Visit operation for each class of ConcreteElement in the
     object structure. The operation's name and signature identifies the
     class that sends the Visit request to the visitor. That lets the
     visitor determine the concrete class of the element being visited.
     Then the visitor can access the element directly through its
     particular interface.

   ConcreteVisitor (TypeCheckingVisitor)
   - implements each operation declared by Visitor. Each operation implements a
     fragment of the algorithm defined for the corresponding class of object in
     the structure. ConcreteVisitor provides the context for the algorithm and
     stores its local state. This state often accumulates results during the
     traversal of the structure.
** -
   Element (Node)
   - defines an Accept operation that takes a visitor as an argument.

   ConcreteElement (AssignmentNode, VariableRefNode)
   - implements an Accept operation that takes a visitor as an argument.

   ObjectStructure (Program)
   - can enumerate its elements.
   - may provide a high-level interface to allow the visitor to visit its
     elements.
   - may either be a composite or a collection such as a list or a set.
* Collaborations
  - A client that uses the Visitor pattern must create a ConcreteVisitor object
    and then traverse the object structure, visiting each element with the
    visitor.
  - When an element is visited, it calls the Visitor operation that corresponds
    to its class. The element supplies itself as an argument to this operation
    to let the visitor access its state, if necessary.

    The following interaction diagram illustrates the collaborations between an
    object structure, a visitor, and two elements:

    [[file:img/visitor Collaborations.png][visitor Collaborations]]
* Consequences
  Some of the benefits and liabilities of the Visitor pattern are as follows:
** 1. Visitor makes adding new operations easy.
   Visitors make it easy to add operations that depend on the components of
   complex objects. You can define a new operation over an object structure
   simply by adding a new visitor. In contrast, if you spread functionality over
   many classes, then you must change each class to define a new operation.
** 2. A visitor gathers related operations and separates unrelated ones.
   Related behavior isn't spread over the classes defining the object structure;
   it's localized in a visitor. Unrelated sets of behavior are partitioned in
   their own visitor subclasses. That simplifies both the classes defining the
   elements and the algorithms defined in the visitors. Any algorithm-specific
   data structures can be hidden in the visitor.
** 3. Adding new ConcreteElement classes is hard.
   The Visitor pattern makes it hard to add new subclasses of Element. Each new
   ConcreteElement gives rise to a new abstract operation on Visitor and a
   corresponding implementation in every ConcreteVisitor class. Sometimes a
   default implementation can be provided in Visitor that can be inherited by
   most of the ConcreteVisitors, but this is the exception rather than the rule.

   So the key consideration in applying the Visitor pattern is whether you are
   mostly likely to change the algorithm applied over an object structure or the
   classes of objects that make up the structure. The Visitor class hierarchy
   can be difficult to maintain when new ConcreteElement classes are added
   frequently. In such cases, it's probably easier just to define operations on
   the classes that make up the structure. If the Element class hierarchy is
   stable, but you are continually adding operations or changing algorithms,
   then the Visitor pattern will help you manage the changes.
** 4. Visiting across class hierarchies.
*** -
    An iterator can visit the objects in a structure as it traverses them by
    calling their operations. But an iterator can't work across object
    structures with different types of elements. For example, the Iterator
    interface defined on Iterator chapter (page 295) can access only objects of
    type Item:
    #+begin_src c++
     template <class Item>
     class Iterator {
       // ...
       Item CurrentItem() const;
     };
    #+end_src
   
    This implies that all elements the iterator can visit have a common parent
    class Item.
*** -
    Visitor does not have this restriction. It can visit objects that don't have
    a common parent class. You can add any type of object to a Visitor interface.
    For example, in
    #+begin_src c++
     class Visitor {
     public:
       // ...
       void VisitMyType(MyType*);

       void VisitYourType(YourType*);
     };
    #+end_src
    MyType and YourType do not have to be related through inheritance at all.
** 5. Accumulating state.
   Visitors can accumulate state as they visit each element in the object
   structure. Without a visitor, this state would be passed as extra arguments
   to the operations that perform the traversal, or they might appear as global
   variables.
** 6. Breaking encapsulation. 
   Visitor's approach assumes that the ConcreteElement interface is powerful
   enough to let visitors do their job. As a result, the pattern often forces
   you to provide public operations that access an element's internal state,
   which may compromise its encapsulation.
* Implementation
** -
   Each object structure will have an associated Visitor class. This abstract
   visitor class declares a VisitConcreteElement operation for each class of
   ConcreteElement defining the object structure. Each Visit operation on the
   Visitor declares its argument to be a particular ConcreteElement, allowing
   the Visitor to access the interface of the ConcreteElement directly.
   ConcreteVisitor classes override each Visit operation to implement
   visitor-specific behavior for the corresponding ConcreteElement class.

   The Visitor class would be declared like this in C++:
   #+begin_src c++
    class Visitor {
    public:
      virtual void VisitElementA(ElementA*);
      virtual void VisitElementB(ElementB*);
      // and so on for other concrete elements
    protected:
      Visitor();
    };
   #+end_src
** -  
   Each class of ConcreteElement implements an Accept operation that calls the
   matching Visit... operation on the visitor for that ConcreteElement. Thus the
   operation that ends up getting called depends on both the class of the
   element and the class of the visitor.
  
   The concrete elements are declared as
   #+begin_src c++
    class Element {
    public:
      virtual ~Element();
      virtual void Accept(Visitor&) = 0;
    protected:
      Element();
    };

    class ElementA : public Element {
    public:
      ElementA();
      virtual void Accept(Visitor& v) { v.VisitElementA(this); }
    };

    class ElementB : public Element {
    public:
      ElementB();
      virtual void Accept(Visitor& v) { v.VisitElementB(this); }
    };
   #+end_src
** -  
   A CompositeElement class might implement Accept like this:
   #+begin_src c++
    class CompositeElement : public Element {
    public:
      virtual void Accept(Visitor&);
    private:
      List<Element*>* _children;
    };

    void CompositeElement::Accept (Visitor& v) {
      ListIterator<Element*> i(_children);
  
      for (i.First(); !i.IsDone(); i.Next()) {
        i.CurrentItem()->Accept(v);
      }

      v.VisitCompositeElement(this);
    }
   #+end_src
** -  
   Here are two other implementation issues that arise when you apply the Visitor
   pattern:
*** 1. Double dispatch. 
**** -    
     Effectively, the Visitor pattern lets you add operations to classes without
     changing them. Visitor achieves this by using a technique called
     double-dispatch. It's a well-known technique. Infact, some programming
     languages support it directly. Languages like C++ and Smalltalk support
     single-dispatch.

     In single-dispatch languages, two criteria determine which operation will
     fulfill a request: the name of the request and the type of receiver. For
     example, the operation that a GenerateCode request will call depends on the
     type of node object you ask. In C++, calling GenerateCode on an instance of
     VariableRefNode will call VariableRefNode::GenerateCode (which generates
     code for avariable reference). Calling GenerateCode on anAssignmentNode will
     call AssignmentNode::GenerateCode (which will generate code for
     anassignment). The operation that gets executed depends both on the kind of
     request and the type of the receiver.
**** -
     "Double-dispatch" simply means the operation that gets executed depends on
     the kind of request and the types of two receivers. Accept is a
     double-dispatch operation. Its meaning depends on two types: the Visitor's
     and the Element's. Double-dispatching lets visitors request different
     operations on each class of element.

     This is the key to the Visitor pattern: The operation that gets executed
     depends on both the type of Visitor and the type of Elementit visits.
     Instead of binding operations statically into the Element interface, you can
     consolidate the operations in a Visitor and use Accept to do the binding at
     run-time. Extending the Element interface amounts to defining one new
     Visitor subclass rather than many newElement subclasses.
***  2. Who is responsible for traversing the object structure?
**** -
     A visitor must visit each element of the object structure. The questionis,
     how does it get there? We can put responsibility for traversal in any of
     three places: in the object structure, in the visitor, or in aseparate
     iterator object.

     Often the object structure is responsible for iteration. A collection will
     simply iterate over its elements, calling the Accept operation on each. A
     composite will commonly traverse itself by having each Accept operation
     traverse the element's children and call Accept on each of them recursively.
**** -
     Another solution is to use an iterator to visit the elements. In C++,you
     could use either an internal or external iterator, depending on what is
     available and what is most efficient. In Smalltalk, you usually use an
     internal iterator using do: and a block. Since internal iterators are
     implemented by the object structure, using an internal iterator is a lot
     like making the object structure responsible for iteration. The main
     difference is that an internal iterator will not cause double-dispatching—it
     will call an operation on the visitor with an element as an argument as
     opposed to calling an operation on the element with the visitor as an
     argument. But it's easy to use the Visitor pattern with an internal iterator
     if the operation on the visitor simply calls the operation on the element
     without recursing.

     You could even put the traversal algorithm in the visitor, although you'll
     end up duplicating the traversal code in each ConcreteVisitor for each
     aggregate ConcreteElement. The main reason to put the traversal strategy in
     the visitor is to implement a particularly complex traversal, one that
     depends on the results of the operations on the object structure. We'll give
     an example of such a case in the Sample Code.
* Sample Code
** -
   Because visitors are usually associated with composites, we'll use the
   Equipment classes defined in the Sample Code of Composite to illustrate the
   Visitor pattern. We will use Visitor to define operations for computing the
   inventory of materials and the total cost for a piece of equipment. The
   Equipment classes are so simple that using Visitor isn't really necessary, but
   they make it easy to see what's involved in implementing the pattern.
** -
   Here again is the Equipment class from Composite. We've augmented it with an
   Accept operation to let it work with a visitor.
   #+begin_src c++
    class Equipment {
    public:
      virtual ~Equipment();
      const char* Name() { return _name; }
      virtual Watt Power();
      virtual Currency NetPrice();
      virtual Currency DiscountPrice();
      virtual void Accept(EquipmentVisitor&);
    protected:
      Equipment(const char*);
    private:
      const char* _name;
    };
   #+end_src
** -  
   The Equipment operations return the attributes of a piece of equipment, such
   as its power consumption and cost. Subclasses redefine these operations
   appropriately for specific types of equipment (e.g.,a chassis, drives, and
   planar boards). The abstract class for all visitors of equipment has a virtual
   function for each subclass of equipment, as shown next. All of the virtual
   functions do nothing by default.
   #+begin_src c++
     class EquipmentVisitor {
     public:
       virtual ~EquipmentVisitor();
       virtual void VisitFloppyDisk(FloppyDisk*);
       virtual void VisitCard(Card*);
       virtual void VisitChassis(Chassis*);
       virtual void VisitBus(Bus*);
       // and so on for other concrete subclasses of Equipment
     protected:
       EquipmentVisitor();
     };
   #+end_src
** -  
   Equipment subclasses define Accept in basically the same way: It calls the
   EquipmentVisitor operation that corresponds to the class that received the
   Accept request, like this:
   #+begin_src c++
     void FloppyDisk::Accept (EquipmentVisitor& visitor) {
       visitor.VisitFloppyDisk(this);
     }
   #+end_src
** -
   Equipment that contains other equipment (in particular, subclasses of
   CompositeEquipment in the Composite pattern) implements Accept by iterating
   over its children and calling Accept on each of them. Then it calls the Visit
   operation as usual. For example, Chassis::Accept could traverseall the parts
   in the chassis as follows:
   #+begin_src c++
     void Chassis::Accept (EquipmentVisitor& visitor) {
       for (
            ListIterator i(_parts);
            !i.IsDone();
            i.Next()
            ) {
         i.CurrentItem()->Accept(visitor);
       }
  
       visitor.VisitChassis(this);
     }
   #+end_src
** -   
   Subclasses of EquipmentVisitor define particular algorithms over the
   equipment structure. The PricingVisitor computes the cost of the equipment
   structure. It computes the net price of all simple equipment (e.g., floppies)
   and the discount price of all composite equipment (e.g., chassis and buses).
   #+begin_src c++
     class PricingVisitor : public EquipmentVisitor {
     public:
       PricingVisitor();
       Currency& GetTotalPrice();
       virtual void VisitFloppyDisk(FloppyDisk*);
       virtual void VisitCard(Card*);
       virtual void VisitChassis(Chassis*);
       virtual void VisitBus(Bus*);
       // ...
     private:
       Currency _total;
     };
   #+end_src
** -   
   #+begin_src c++
     void PricingVisitor::VisitFloppyDisk (FloppyDisk* e) {
       _total += e->NetPrice();
     }

     void PricingVisitor::VisitChassis (Chassis* e) {
       _total += e->DiscountPrice();
     }
   #+end_src
** -   
   PricingVisitor will compute the total cost of all nodes in the equipment
   structure. Note that PricingVisitor chooses the appropriate pricing policy
   for a class of equipment by dispatching to the corresponding member function.
   What's more, we can change the pricing policy of an equipment structure just
   by changing the PricingVisitor class.

   We can define a visitor for computing inventory like this:
   #+begin_src c++
     class InventoryVisitor : public EquipmentVisitor {
     public:
       InventoryVisitor();
       Inventory& GetInventory();
       virtual void VisitFloppyDisk(FloppyDisk*);
       virtual void VisitCard(Card*);
       virtual void VisitChassis(Chassis*);
       virtual void VisitBus(Bus*);
       // ...
     private:
       Inventory _inventory;
     };
   #+end_src
** -   
   The InventoryVisitor accumulates the totals for each type of equipment in the
   object structure. InventoryVisitor uses an Inventory class that defines an
   interface for adding equipment(which we won't bother defining here).
   #+begin_src c++
     void InventoryVisitor::VisitFloppyDisk (FloppyDisk* e) {
       _inventory.Accumulate(e);
     }

     void InventoryVisitor::VisitChassis (Chassis* e) {
       _inventory.Accumulate(e);
     }
   #+end_src
** -   
   Here's how we can use an InventoryVisitor on anequipment structure:
   #+begin_src c++
     Equipment* component;
     InventoryVisitor visitor;
     component->Accept(visitor);
     cout << "Inventory "
     << component->Name()
     << visitor.GetInventory();
   #+end_src
** small talk version   
   Now we'll show how to implement the Smalltalk example from the Interpreter pattern
   (see page 279) with theVisitor pattern. Like the previous example, this one is
   so small thatVisitor probably won't buy us much, but it provides a good illustration
   ofhow to use the pattern. Further, it illustrates a situation in whichiteration
   is the visitor's responsibility.
   The object structure (regular expressions) is made of four classes,and all of
   them have an accept: method that takes thevisitor as an argument. In class
   SequenceExpression, theaccept: method is
   accept: aVisitor
   ^ aVisitor visitSequence: self
   In class RepeatExpression, the accept: methodsends the visitRepeat: message.In
   class AlternationExpression, it sends thevisitAlternation: message.In class
   LiteralExpression, it sends thevisitLiteral: message.
   378Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
   The four classes also must have accessing functions that the visitorcan use. For
   SequenceExpression these areexpression1 and expression2;
   forAlternationExpression these are alternative1and alternative2;
   forRepeatExpression it is repetition; and forLiteralExpression these are
   components.
**** -
     The ConcreteVisitor class is REMatchingVisitor. Itis responsible for the traversal
     because its traversal algorithmis irregular. The biggest irregularity is that
     aRepeatExpression will repeatedly traverse its component.The class
     REMatchingVisitor has an instance variableinputState. Its methods are essentially
     the same asthe match: methods of the expression classes in theInterpreter pattern
     except theyreplace the argument named inputState with theexpression node being
     matched. However, theystill return the set of streams that the expression would
     matchto identify the current state.

     inputState := sequenceExp expression1 accept: self.

* Known Uses
  The Smalltalk-80 compiler has a Visitor class called
  ProgramNodeEnumerator.It's used primarily for algorithms that analyze source
  code.It isn't used for code generation or pretty-printing, although it could
  be.

  IRIS Inventor [Str93]is a toolkit for developing 3-D graphics applications.
  Inventorrepresents a three-dimensional scene as a hierarchy of nodes,
  eachrepresenting either a geometric object or an attribute of one.Operations
  like rendering a scene or mapping an input event requiretraversing this
  hierarchy in different ways. Inventor does thisusing visitors called
  "actions." There are different visitors forrendering, event handling,
  searching, filing, and determiningbounding boxes.

  To make adding new nodes easier, Inventor implements adouble-dispatch scheme
  for C++. The scheme relies on run-time typeinformation and a two-dimensional
  table in which rows representvisitors and columns represent node classes. The
  cells store apointer to the function bound to the visitor and node class.

  Mark Linton coined the term "Visitor" in the X Consortium'sFresco Application
  Toolkit specification [LP93].
* Related Patterns
  Composite (183):Visitors can be used to apply an operation over an object
  structuredefined by the Composite pattern.

  Interpreter (274):Visitor may be applied to do the interpretation.
